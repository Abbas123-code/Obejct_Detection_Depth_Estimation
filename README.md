##  Project Overview
This project uses **YOLOv8x** for **2D object detection** and leverages **intrinsic camera parameters** from the **KITTI dataset** to estimate the **3D depth of detected cars**.  
The main goal is to analyze how accurately depth estimation corresponds to ground-truth values and identify factors affecting discrepancies.

**Guided by:** Prof. Dr. Stefan Elser

## 🔥 Approach
1. **Object Detection**  
   - **YOLOv8x** was used to detect cars and draw bounding boxes.  
   - Bounding box coordinates (`x1, y1, x2, y2`) were saved for each detected object.

2. **Ground Truth Comparison**  
   - Ground truth boxes were extracted from KITTI labels.
   - **Intersection over Union (IoU)** was used to match predictions with ground truth.  

   **Precision & Recall:**

   \[
   Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}, \quad Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
   \]

3. **Filtering False Positives**  
   - Predictions with IoU < 0.5 were treated as false positives.

## 🧠 Depth Estimation Method
Depth estimation was done using **camera intrinsic parameters**.

### **Formulas**

### **Formulas**

1. **Intrinsic Matrix**  
K = | fx   0   cx |  
   | 0    fy  cy |  
   | 0    0    1 |

2. **3D Direction Vector**  
d = inverse(K) · p

3. **Depth & 3D Coordinates**  
Z = h / dz  
X = Z · dx  
Y = Z · dy

4. **Distance from Camera**  
Distance = √(X² + Y² + Z²)

##  Results

###  Images with Proper Detection
- Accurate depth estimation for clear, unobstructed cars.  
- Good performance up to **40 meters**.

###  Complex Scenarios
- Errors due to:
  - Occlusions
  - False positives
  - Poor lighting/weather conditions

###  No Detection
- Cases where no cars were detected in the frame.

### **Overall**
- Depth estimation error increases as objects move further away.
